2:T618,My journey as a software engineer began back in college, where I was first introduced to programming and problem-solving through Data Structures and Algorithms. DSA not only strengthened my logical thinking but also helped me understand how software works at a deeper level. During this time, I became more involved in coding challenges, projects, and exploring different technologies, which laid the foundation for my career. I landed my first job at ARC Document Solutions, and that’s where my real professional journey began. At ARC, I transitioned from being a student with theoretical knowledge to a developer who builds real-world applications. I started learning and working with industry-relevant technologies such as React.js, Node.js, and Flask, along with a wide range of tools and platforms like Postman, Bugzilla, Git, npm, and yarn. As I worked on production-level systems, I gained hands-on experience with important concepts like user authentication, session handling, environment-level configurations, and how large-scale applications are maintained in real-world environments. These experiences helped me understand how different parts of a system connect, how teams collaborate, and how software evolves from development to deployment. Today, I continue to grow as a developer—building modern, scalable, and user-focused applications. Every project I work on helps me become better, and every challenge pushes me to learn more. My goal is to keep improving, explore advanced technologies, and contribute to meaningful software solutions.0:{"buildId":"0lT_wgefnXDLp216D0Yi-","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","section",null,{"children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"About Me — Journey of a Software Engineer"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"$2"}]]}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
