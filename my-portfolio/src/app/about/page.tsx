      <h1>About Me — Journey of a Software Engineer</h1>
      <p>
        My journey as a software engineer began back in college, where I was
        first introduced to programming and problem-solving through Data
        Structures and Algorithms. DSA not only strengthened my logical thinking
        but also helped me understand how software works at a deeper level.
        During this time, I became more involved in coding challenges, projects,
        and exploring different technologies, which laid the foundation for my
        career. I landed my first job at ARC Document Solutions, and that’s
        where my real professional journey began. At ARC, I transitioned from
        being a student with theoretical knowledge to a developer who builds
        real-world applications. I started learning and working with
        industry-relevant technologies such as React.js, Node.js, and Flask,
        along with a wide range of tools and platforms like Postman, Bugzilla,
        Git, npm, and yarn. As I worked on production-level systems, I gained
        hands-on experience with important concepts like user authentication,
        session handling, environment-level configurations, and how large-scale
        applications are maintained in real-world environments. These
        experiences helped me understand how different parts of a system
        connect, how teams collaborate, and how software evolves from
        development to deployment. Today, I continue to grow as a
        developer—building modern, scalable, and user-focused applications.
        Every project I work on helps me become better, and every challenge
        pushes me to learn more. My goal is to keep improving, explore advanced
        technologies, and contribute to meaningful software solutions.
